# Saab340APerformanceCalculator

Hello and thank you for showing interest in the SAAB340a Opensource performance tool for flightsimulation purposes. 
The tool is coded using real world speed tables for the actual plane itself making the tool extremly accurate in its predictions. 

By contributing to this project you selflesly help out expanding the hobby thus making life for all saab340 pilots out there so much easier!
Thank you!

If you wish to contribute please contact me ether here via github or even better, write me an email at drago@flightsimsweden.se and I will get you started.

Warmest regards,
Dragoljub (Drago) Blagojevic
